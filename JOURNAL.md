I recieved my 2nd LoRa module and can finally do some testing. I messed around with the LoRa library for aruduino made by Sandeep Mistry.
I tested the Lora module without the antennas and I didn't know that it was a big mistake as it could destroy the radio module and I also found out my LoRa modules are not communicating properly (as long as they are designed for) so i might have fried them.
