I recieved my 2nd LoRa module and can finally do some testing. I messed around with the LoRa library for aruduino made by Sandeep Mistry.
I tested the Lora module without the antennas and I didn't know that it was a big mistake as it could destroy the radio module and I also found out my LoRa modules are not communicating properly (as long as they are designed for) so i might have fried them.

Today, me and Ghost met up to test the LoRa module I bought the other week since she's unsure if hers works :P
Turns out, both of her LoRa modules got fried (RIP),,, so uh that's great... but at least the "Lo"Ra modules do still work short-range (like a few cm apart) so we can still test that
Outside of that, we also tested the accelerometer / gyro module, and seems to work? i don't understand the readings tho :sob: it's confusing...
We decided to just stop buying new components for now, and work with what we have first, focussing on creating CAD and PCB models first to get the stippends as the entire group is like,,, really broke...
